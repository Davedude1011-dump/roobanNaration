Bob's alarm clock blares at exactly 6:00 am, signaling the start of another day. He groggily gets out of bed and stretches, feeling his short and fat body creak and pop. He takes a quick shower, getting ready for another long day ahead.

Once he's dressed, Bob heads out of his -5 story apartment and makes his way to the international subway train station. He hops on the train, pulling out his classical music playlist and his trusty pair of headphones. He starts rapping along to the music, completely unfazed by the strange looks he gets from his fellow commuters.

As the train chugs along, Bob takes out his phone and starts watching Spongebob in ancient Greek with German subtitles, chuckling to himself at the show's silly antics. He arrives at work, a waffle house that only serves food in its gas form, and starts his shift.

Bob has a side job as a military officer commanding a legion of soldiers that protect a house belonging to a person named "Alfie" which is in the Bermuda Triangle. He often has to take calls during his shifts at the waffle house, but he manages to balance both jobs with ease.

After his shift ends, Bob heads to the local bar where he works as a bartender. He chats with his regulars and serves them their drinks, all while tapping his foot to the classical music playing on the bar's speakers.

Finally, after a long day, Bob heads back to his apartment. He greets his son Crease, who's just getting home from Backrooms Secondary School. They chat about their day, and Bob helps Crease with his homework.

Bob sits down on his couch with his cat Harrison, who's nestled on his lap. Harrison is 87.1 years old and has eaten countless Backrooms monsters, but he's still going strong. Bob flips on the TV and starts watching a rerun of Spongebob, laughing at the jokes he's heard a hundred times before.

As the night wears on, Bob starts to feel his eyelids droop. He tucks Crease in and makes sure Harrison has enough food and water for the night. Finally, he crawls into bed, feeling content with another day lived to the fullest.
